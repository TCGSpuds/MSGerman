This code uses the Pokemon API to get the details of the trading card and the Cardmarket API to get the price of the card.
The image recognition API is used to get the text from the image/video of the trading card.
The extracted card details, language, and price are then used to sort the trading cards into two categories - German and Other.

Note: 
The function "image_to_text" and "extract_card_details" are not provided in this code and need to be implemented based on the requirements.
